# Plot Digitizer (Colour + B&W)

A local web app that extracts the underlying data points from PK/PD
concentration–time plots (and similar scientific figures). It has two modes:

- **Colour** — separates curves by colour (classic computer-vision pipeline).
- **B&W** — detects markers by shape with a ViT model (deep-learning pipeline).

Both modes feed the same in-browser editor, so you can review, correct, and
download the extracted points as a spreadsheet. Everything runs on your own
machine; nothing is uploaded.

## Get the code

Project page: **https://github.com/hjpark0820/plot-digitizer**

**Option A — Download ZIP (no git needed):**
Open the page above, click the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**, and
unzip it. You get a `plot-digitizer` folder with everything inside.

**Option B — git clone (easy updates later):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hjpark0820/plot-digitizer.git
# later, to get the newest version:
cd plot-digitizer && git pull
```

## Required files

Only the files below are needed to run the app. Everything else (training,
evaluation, and experimental code) can be removed.

```

That is **13 files in `src/`**, plus `models/chart_marker_net_v3.pth`,
`requirements.txt`, and this README.

> **Notes on cleanup**
> - Keep **one** `requirements.txt` at the repository root. The old `src/`
>   requirements list is the correct one (it includes `timm`, needed by the ViT
>   detector, and omits the unused `ultralytics`/`sahi`); move its contents to the
>   root and delete any duplicate.
> - `3_segment_detection.py` (the original, non-`_v2`) is **not** needed:
>   `chart_preprocessing.py` now loads `3_segment_detection_v2.py`. Delete the
>   original after verifying detection on your test images.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12** (3.10+ works).
- **Tesseract OCR** — used by Colour mode to read axis numbers automatically.
  Optional if you always type axis values by hand.
  - Windows: install from the UB Mannheim Tesseract build (default location
    `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).
  - macOS: `brew install tesseract`
  - Linux: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`

### Python packages

```bash
# Web layer
pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" python-multipart

# Colour pipeline
pip install opencv-python numpy scipy matplotlib openpyxl pytesseract

# B&W pipeline (deep learning — larger download)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS/Linux use `python3`/`pip3`. On Windows, if `pip` is not found, use
`python -m pip ...`.

> The Colour mode does **not** need PyTorch. If you only use Colour mode you can
> skip `pip install -r requirements.txt` — the heavy deep-learning packages are
> imported only when B&W mode is used.

---

## Running the app

```bash
cd src
python unified_server.py          # macOS/Linux: python3 unified_server.py
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.
(Use `localhost`, not `0.0.0.0`.) Keep the terminal window open while you use the
app; press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

---

## Using it

1. **Choose PNG** — upload your plot image.
2. **Mode** — pick Colour or B&W.
3. **Draw** the plot area (and the legend) by dragging a rectangle.
4. **Axis values** — enter x/y min & max; tick *log scale* for log axes.
   Scientific notation is accepted (`1e-15`, `10^-15`).
5. **B&W only** — tick the marker shapes present; choose Auto or Manual scale.
6. **Run** — review the overlay.
7. **Correct** — open the editor to drag / add / delete points. In B&W mode you
   can also **Run Step 5 correction** to refine the points automatically and
   compare before/after.
8. **Download** the data as a spreadsheet.

---

## Notes

- The B&W model file is `models/chart_marker_net_v3.pth`. The server passes this
  to both detection and Step-5 correction.
- The first B&W run in a session is slower because the model loads once.
- For best B&W accuracy, tick **only** the marker shapes actually present in your
  plot rather than leaving all of them selected.
